Jimmy and Kirsten Terra both grew up with the mountain culture of the Wood River Valley.  They are long time locals involved in the community and the adventurous spirit that accompanies the town.  Jimmy is a ski patroller for Sun Valley and a volunteer firefighter with Ketchum Fire Department.  In his free time he prefers to be outside exploring the beautiful area.  Kirsten was born and raised in Ketchum because it was home base for her ski racer father.  She has been educated in the outdoors and enjoys the many sports the area has to offer.  They are raising their family here because...well you can't beat it and all the valley has to offer.
