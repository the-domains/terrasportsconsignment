I, the undersigned, deliver
to Terra Sports Consignment items from today's date forward on the following
terms and conditions:

1\. The items are delivered
to Terra Sports Consignment on a consignment basis.  Terra Sports Consignment reserves the right
to refuse any item.  Items cannot be
taken out by the consignor for thirty days after the items have been consigned.

2\. Terra Sports Consignment
shall accept possession of the items and sell these items for my account at a
cost specified by Terra Sports Consignment.  Terra Sports Consignment will collect and pay all applicable sales tax.

3\.  I give Terra Sports Consignment permission to
display, promote and sell any and all of the items in the retail store and/or
through e-commerce.

4\.  Title to the items shall pass directly from
me to the purchaser.  I represent and
warrant that I am the owner of the items consigned and that the items are in
good working condition.

5\.  All proceeds received from the sale shall be
available for me to pick up within fourteen days of the sale of the consigned
item.  Requested checks will be cut on
the 1st and 15th of each month.  If I choose to use my proceeds as store
credit I will receive 15% off my in store purchase (not valid on sale
items).  I understand that all proceeds
not picked up after six months from the consignment date shall be void.

6\.  Compensation for the undersigned shall be 50
percent of the price at which items are sold. There will be a sliding percentage
scale for items over $400.00\.  $400 to $600-
40%, $600 to $800- 35%, $800 and over- 25% compensation.  Large items not displayed in store will take
a 15% finder's fee.

7\.  If at anytime Terra Sports Consignment shall
deem it advisable to return items prior to their sale, Terra Sports Consignment
will notify me and I shall pick up the items within fourteen days of
notice.  If I fail to pick up the items
within fourteen days, Terra Sports Consignment may dispose of the items.

8\. The consignment period
shall be 6 months, or its summer/winter selling season. Items can be
reconsigned for another period.

9\.  If I fail to pick up the items within 14 days
of being notified, Terra Sports Consignment may dispose of the items as deemed
appropriate, and collect all proceeds therefore.

10\.  I understand Terra Sports Consignment will
take the best care possible, but cannot be held responsible for loss, damage,
theft or other circumstances beyond their control.

11\.  Terra Sports Consignment's acceptance of the
items on consignment shall constitute full acceptance of the terms hereof.
